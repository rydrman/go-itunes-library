# Go Itunes Library Parser

Due to the unique way that Apple uses the XML format to save iTunes libraries, I have created this small go library to handle parsing the data.

I will be using this library in my own tool for exporting itunes libraries to Spotify, and hopefully you will find uses for this code as well.

Please do! If you could run everything through gofmt before submission that would be great, but as this is a tiny library I am not going to be picky.
